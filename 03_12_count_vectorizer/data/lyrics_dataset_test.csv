Incubus,papershoes,I fly I soar This I Adore  And then like a locomotive The sound of your sorrow comes I'm tired of the way that it feels I only apologized to you to make you feel better But I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater  I'd rather be alone You're about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weather But pain will roll off like water on feather  You'd fly You'd soar  But then like a locomotive The sound of your sorrow comes I'm tired of the way that it feels I only apologized to you to make you feel better But I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater  I'd rather be on my own You're about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers But pain will roll off like water on feathers  I'm tired of the way that it feels I only apologized to you to make you feel better But I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater  I'd rather be on my own You're about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers But pain will roll off like water on feathers
Taylor Swift,thereyourtrouble,"Should have been different but It wasn't different, was it Same old story, dear john, And so long Should have fit like a glove Should have fit like a ring Like a diamond ring A token of true love Should have all worked out But it didn't She should be here now But she isn't  There's your trouble, There's your trouble You keep seeing double With the wrong one You can't see I love you, You can't see she doesn't But you just keep holding on There's your trouble  So now you're thinking 'bout All you're missing how Deep you're sinking, Round and round and dragging down Why don't you cash in your chips Why don't you call it a loss Not such a big loss, Chalk it up better luck Could have been true love But it wasn't It should all add up But it doesn't  There's your trouble, There's your trouble You keep seeing double With the wrong one You can't see I love you, You can't see she doesn't But you just keep holding on There's your trouble  Should have all worked out But it didn't She should be here now But she isn't  There's your trouble, There's your trouble You keep seeing double With the wrong one You can't see I love you, You can't see she doesn't But you just keep holding on There's your trouble"
Incubus,mexico,You could see me reaching So why couldn't you have met me halfway You could see me bleeding But you could not put pressure on the wound  You only think about yourself You only think about yourself You'd better bend before I go On the first train to Mexico  You could see me breathing But you still kept your hand over my mouth You could feel me seething But you just turned your nose up in the air  You only think about yourself You only think about yourself You'd better bend before I go On the first train to Mexico  You only think about yourself You only think about yourself You'd better bend before I go On the first train to Mexico
Incubus,speakfree,"You took our lives away To increase your self esteem An underlie in the public eye Your dubbed insane if and when You try to speak your mind in your own way  Ignore the past and speak free You smashed glass eyes just to say ""It all is all that I need"" What you see is a reflection of my choice And what it means to me  Trapped in your cell A mindless plot against own eyes To simplify your hell Just ease my pain"
Taylor Swift,amireadyforlove,"Sometimes I wonder How its gonna feel Will my first love be true and real Will I be ready when My heart starts to fall What will I do when my love comes to call  And my daddy tells me That I light up his world Everyday he says ""Darlin, You're my best girl"" He tried to teach me From the very start The meaning of love So nobody breaks my heart  Will my love come in a bowl of fire? Will it be filled with hope and desire? Will my love come in the pourin' rain? Am I ready for the joy? Am I ready for the pain? Am I ready for the boy? Am I ready for love? For love  I know I'm not a little Girl anymore Cuz I'm feeling things I've never felt before Sweet sensations And anticipations Calling commotion To my emotions  And I hear the words My daddy says to me He said ""be true to yourself And keep your spirit free And love will find you One way or another Be good to yourself And be good to each other""  Will my love come in a bowl of fire? Will it be filled with hope and desire? Will my love come in the pourin' rain? Am I ready for the joy? Am I ready for the pain? Am I ready for the joy? Am I ready for the pain? Am I ready for love?  Its a run around the world And its moving so fast Though I wanna find A love thats gonna last A love so strong That it can withstand The weight of the world In the palm of its hand  Will my love come in a bowl of fire? Will it be filled with hope and desire? Will my love come in the pourin' rain? Am I ready for the joy? Am I ready for the pain? Am I ready for the boy? Am I ready for this game? Am I ready for the kiss? Am i ready for the stars? Am I ready for the bliss? Am I ready for love?"

Taylor Swift,vivalavida,"I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listened as the crowd would sing Now the old king is dead long live the king One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield Missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you'd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was a wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know St Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know St Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world"

Taylor Swift,sparksfly,"The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm And I'm a house of cards You're the kind of reckless that should send me running But I kinda know that I won't get far  And you stood there in front of me Just close enough to touch Close enough to hope you couldn't See what I was thinking of  Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain 'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  Get me with those green eyes, baby As the lights go down Give me something that'll haunt me When you're not around  'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  My mind forgets to remind me You're a bad idea You touch me once and it's really something You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be  I'm on my guard for the rest of the world But with you, I know it's no good And I could wait patiently But I really wish you would  Drop everything now Meet me in the pouring rain Kiss me on the sidewalk Take away the pain  Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain 'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  Get me with those green eyes, baby As the lights go down Give me something that'll haunt me When you're not around  'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  I'll run my fingers through your hair And watch the lights go wild Just keep on keeping your eyes on me It's just wrong enough to make it feel right  And lead me up the staircase Won't you whisper soft and slow I'm captivated by you, baby Like a fireworks show  Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain 'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  Get me with those green eyes, baby As the lights go down Give me something that'll haunt me When you're not around  'Cause I see sparks fly Whenever you smile  And the parks fly Oh, baby, smile And the sparks fly"

Incubus,aqueoustransmission,I'm floating down a river Oars freed from their holes long ago Lying face up on the floor of my vessel I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  Two weeks without my lover I'm in this boat alone Floating down a river named emotion Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  I'm building an antenna Transmissions will be sent when I am through Maybe we could meet again further down the river And share what we both discovered then revel in the view  Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river Further down the river  I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river  I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river I'm floating down a river
